# RR_Starbucks

## Introduction

- our project is based on the Kaggle project: Starbucks Customer Survey.

- This dataset is composed of survey questions of over 100 respondents about their buying behavior at Starbucks.

- The main idea of our project is to reproduce the original findings using the original data and collect new data with Google form then replicate the results with the new data.
