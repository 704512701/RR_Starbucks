## Introduction

- our project is based on the Kaggle project: Starbucks Customer Survey.

- This dataset is composed of survey questions of over 100 respondents about their buying behavior at Starbucks.

- The main idea of our project is to reproduce the original findings using the original data and collect new data with Google form then replicate the results with the new data.

- A questionnaire was made using Google form, and 39 samples were collected. We use these samples to evaluate and report on customer profiling, areas of satisfaction, and demographics to target for potential growth opportunities. The questionnaire included 20 questions, the first four questions were personal information about the participants, and the remaining questions were about our topic: *Starbucks*.

- requirements to re-run the obtained results are:

`R version 4.1.3`, `rmarkdown 2.14`, `tidyverse 1.3.2`, `tibble 3.1.8`.

```{r, echo = F, include=FALSE}

### Gender distribution - original

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='50%', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\zhaoz\\Desktop\\RR_Starbucks-main\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\gender distribution.png")
```
Source: Original data analysis figure.


- What we’ve gleaned is that gender is not distributed fairly, skew towards Male customers. 



## Explorations

### Income distribution (Feamle and Male)

```{r, echo = F}
# Income distribution
p1a <- ggplot(starbucks_revise, aes(x = Income_Bracket))

p1b <- p1a + geom_bar(aes(fill=Income_Bracket))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

p1b

### Income distribution (Feamle and Male) - original
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='50%', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\zhaoz\\Desktop\\RR_Starbucks-main\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\p1.png")
```

- We can see that incomes of many participants are less than 25,000PLN. High-income participants make up a small percentage.



## Explorations

### Gender and income

- Then we combine gender and income to get a broader view.
```{r, echo = F}
# combine gender and income to get a broader view.
p2a <- ggplot(starbucks_revise, aes(x = Gender))

p2b <- p2a + geom_bar(aes(fill=Income_Bracket))

p2b

```

- So while customers that identify as ‘female’ outnumber ‘male’-identifying customers, they also appear to fall into lower income brackets more frequently.

- We want to do some more quantitative measurements of the data. So we will create male and female income dataframes.


## Explorations
### Gender and income
#### Females' income

```{r, echo = F}
# Creat Male and Female Income DFs
Gender_Income <- as.data.frame(starbucks_revise %>% count(Gender, Income_Bracket))

Female_Income <- data.frame(subset(Gender_Income, Gender == 'Female'))
Male_Income   <- data.frame(subset(Gender_Income, Gender == 'Male'))

rownames(Male_Income) <- seq(1:nrow(Male_Income))
# Summarize each income bracket by gender
sumFemale_Income <- sum(Female_Income$n)
```

```{r, echo = F}
# Here we create a dataframe for each gender that contains the average count for each income bracket.
Female_Income_Prct <- data.frame(Income_Bracket = character(), Percentage_F = numeric())

for (i in 1:nrow(Female_Income)){
  avg <- as.double(Female_Income[i,'n'] / sumFemale_Income)
  avg_brkt <- c(as.character(Female_Income[i,'Income_Bracket']), as.numeric(round(avg, 3)))
  Female_Income_Prct[i,] <- avg_brkt
}

Female_Income_Prct$Percentage <- as.numeric(as.character(Female_Income_Prct$Percentage))

Female_Income_Prct$Percentage_F = NULL
# Result
Female_Income_Prct

## Explorations
### Gender and income
#### Males' income

```{r, echo = F}
# Do the same to "Male"
# Same process here as the female.
sumMale_Income <- sum(Male_Income$n)

Male_Income_Prct <- data.frame(Income_Bracket = character(), Percentage_M = numeric())

for (i in 1:nrow(Male_Income)){
  avg <- as.double(Male_Income[i,'n'] / sumMale_Income)
  avg_brkt <- c(as.character(Male_Income[i,'Income_Bracket']), as.numeric(round(avg, 3)))
  Male_Income_Prct[i,] <- avg_brkt
}

Male_Income_Prct$Percentage <- as.numeric(as.character(Male_Income_Prct$Percentage))

```

## Explorations
### Gender and income
#### Combine income and gender (1/2)

- Then we combine income and gender.
```{r, echo = F}
# And now join them together.
Income_Prct <- merge(Male_Income_Prct, Female_Income_Prct, by = 'Income_Bracket', all.x = TRUE)

colnames(Income_Prct) <- c('IncomeBracket', 'Percent_M', 'Percent_F')

Income_Prct[is.na(Income_Prct)] <- 0

Income_Prct <- gather(Income_Prct, key = 'Gender', value = 'Percent', 2:3)

Income_Prct$Percent <- Income_Prct$Percent * 100
# result
Income_Prct
```

```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


## Explorations
### Gender and income
#### Combine income and gender (2/2)

- We can show them in a barplot.

```{r, echo = F}
# plot Income Bracket
p3a <- ggplot(Income_Prct, aes(x = factor(IncomeBracket, level = order_income), y = Percent, fill = Gender))

p3b <- p3a + geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') +
  coord_flip()+
  xlab('Income Bracket') +
  geom_text(aes(label = Percent), position = position_dodge2(width = 0.9), vjust = 0.5)

p3b
```

## Explorations

#### Combine income and gender (2/2) - original
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='50%', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\zhaoz\\Desktop\\RR_Starbucks-main\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\p3.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


- We can see from this barplot, over 40%  males occupy the higher income brackets (any more that 50,000PLN), most of females occupy the lower income brackets.

- So we can assume that when the gender distribution is fairly even female-identifying customers lean more towards the lower income brackets,  while more males occupy the higher income brackets.


## Explorations

### 7 rated questions and Gender (1/3)

- Here are 7 more survey questions to score, and we'll analyze them next with gender.
```{r, echo = F}
# Here are 7 more survey questions to score, and we'll analyze them next with gender.
surveyAnswers <- starbucks_revise %>% select(c('Gender', 'Quality_Rating', 'Price_Rating', 'Sales_Promo_Rating',
                                               'Ambience_Rating', 'WiFi_Rating', 'Service_Rating', 'Meetup_Rating'))

surveyAnswers_2 <- gather(surveyAnswers, key = 'Metric', value = "Rating", 2:8)

survey_by_Gender <- tapply(surveyAnswers_2$Rating, surveyAnswers_2$Gender, mean)
# result
survey_by_Gender
```

```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


- Males are slightly more favorable overall towards the brand (3.55), but not much more than women (3.49).

- In general, the feelings are leaning on the ‘satisfied’ side of ‘neutral’.

## Explorations

### 7 rated questions and Gender (2/3)

- We can create a collated dataframe of all the surveyed, ranked variables by gender.
```{r, echo = F}
# Creating a collated dataframe of all the surveyed, ranked variables by gender.
metricsList <- c('Ambience_Rating', 'Sales_Promo_Rating', 'Quality_Rating', 'Price_Rating', 'WiFi_Rating','Service_Rating', 'Meetup_Rating')

# We made a function to act over the different metrics.
metric_mean <- function(metric){
  metric_subset <- subset(surveyAnswers_2, Metric == metric)
  return <- c(tapply(metric_subset$Rating, metric_subset$Gender, mean))
}


for (i in metricsList){
  metricmean <- metric_mean(i)
  if (i == 'Ambience_Rating'){
    surveyMeansDF = data.frame('AmbRat' = metricmean)
  }
  else{
    surveyMeansDF[[i]] <- metricmean
  }
}

surveyMeansDF <- rownames_to_column(surveyMeansDF)

colnames(surveyMeansDF)[which(names(surveyMeansDF) == 'rowname')] <- 'Gender'
# result

```

Source: Original data analysis figure.

- The results are not very different by gender. Men and women are fairly similar in their ratings, but there are some difference in a few areas: Women are more satisfied with *Sales/Promotions*, while men are more satisfied with *the use of Starbucks for meetings/get-togethers* and  *quality of coffee*.




## Explorations

### Spending and Gender (1/2)

- Check which gender spends more per trip: “Spending”.
```{r, echo = F}
# Check which gender spends more per trip: “Spending”.
spendingDF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Gender, Spending, Membership)

spendingDF <- spendingDF %>% count(Gender, Spending, Membership)

### Spending and Gender (2/2)

```{r, echo = F}
# use ordered spending data
order_spending <- c('0 PLN', 'Less than 20 PLN', '20 PLN - 40 PLN', 'More than 40 PLN')
# plot
pl_spending <- ggplot(spending_byGenDF, aes(x = factor(Spending, levels = order_spending), y = n), levels)

```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


- We can see that most of the cost are in the range greater than 0 PLN but not more than 40 PLN. The top overall spends 20 PLN - 40 PLN. While more men spend between 20 PLN and 40 PLN, and only men spend more than 40 PLN at a time in this survey.

- So we can conclude that *men are more willing than women to pay for a visit, regardless of the amount*.


## Explorations

### Membership and Gender

- Next, we analyze whether membership is related to Gender.
```{r, echo = F}
# Let’s see if there’s a gender disparity with members:
memberDF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Gender, Membership)

memberDF <- memberDF %>% count(Gender, Membership)
# result
memberDF
```

knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\zhaoz\\Desktop\\RR_Starbucks-main\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\MemeberDF.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


- Men are more likely to have a membership than women.


## Explorations

### Willingness to continue buying and Gender

- Now that we know that men and women rate Starbucks similarly but not identically, we will analyze whether there is a significant difference in the willingness to continue to buy between different genders.
```{r, echo = F}
# For now, we are going to do a couple more comparisons.
continuebuyingDF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Gender, Cont_Buying)

continuebuyingDF <- continuebuyingDF %>% count(Gender, Cont_Buying)
# result
continuebuyingDF

```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


- About 87% participants say they’ll keep going to Starbucks. So most of men and women are willing to continue to buy Starbucks, regardless of variable gender.


## Explorations

###  Membership and Spending

- The difference in spending between members and non-members
```{r, echo = F}
# Spending and Membership:
buying_member_DF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Membership, Spending)

buying_member_DF <- buying_member_DF %>% count(Membership, Spending)
# result
buying_member_DF

knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\zhaoz\\Desktop\\RR_Starbucks-main\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\buyingmember_DF.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.

- Members and non-Members are spending about the same.


## Explorations

### Willing to continue buying and Membership

- We know that members' willingness to continue to buy is unquestionable, but we do not know the willingness of non-members to continue to buy, so we analyze the willingness of members and non-members to continue to buy.
```{r, echo = F}
## Membership and Willingness to continue buying
cont_member_DF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Membership, Cont_Buying)

cont_member_DF <- cont_member_DF %>% count(Membership, Cont_Buying)
# result
cont_member_DF
```

## Explorations

### Willing to continue buying and Membership - original
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='50%', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\zhaoz\\Desktop\\RR_Starbucks-main\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\membercout_buying.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.

- In our survey, members and non-Members are spending about the same. However, members are generally the only group that will spend more than 40 PLN (that group is entirely men).

- Also, men are more likely to spend 20PLN - 40PLN, where as women are less likely to spend in the upper half of the spending brackets.

- Among non-members, the gap between who will continue to buy and who will not continue to buy is not large.


## Summary

- Women are more satisfied with *Sales/Promotions*, while men are more satisfied with *the use of Starbucks for meetings/get-togethers* and  *quality of coffee*.

- Men and women are in consensus that the factor from the survey in most need of improvement is pricing.

- Women are generally more satisfied about Starbucks across all measured metrics, except pricing.

- Males are more likely to have a membership than women.
