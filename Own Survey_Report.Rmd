## Introduction

A questionnaire was made using Google form, and 39 samples were collected. We use these samples to evaluate and report on customer profiling, areas of satisfaction, and demographics to target for potential growth opportunities. The questionnaire included 20 questions, the first four questions were personal information about the participants, and the remaining questions were about our topic: *Starbucks*.

## Explorations

Firstly get distributions of following variables: gender, income and spending.
```{r, echo = F}
# Rename the variables since some of them are descriptive but way too long.
starbucks <- starbucks %>% rename(UniqID = Timestamp,
                                  Gender = Gender,

```

```{r, echo = F}
# change the date/time variables to UniqIDs, and make the character variables into factors.
starbucks <- starbucks %>%
  mutate(UniqID = 1:nrow(starbucks)) %>%
  relocate(UniqID, .before=Gender)

starbucks_revise <- starbucks %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
```

### Gender distribution

```{r, echo = F}
# Order variable "income" 
unique(starbucks_revise$Income_Bracket)
order_income <- c('Less than 25,000PLN', '25,000PLN - 50,000PLN', '50,000PLN - 100,000PLN', '100,000PLN - 150,000PLN', 
                  'More than 150,000PLN')

starbucks_revise$Income_Bracket <- factor(starbucks_revise$Income_Bracket, levels = order_income)
```

```{r, echo = F}
# Gender distribution
distGender <- data.frame(starbucks_revise %>%
                           count(Gender))

Gender_report <- distGender %>% mutate(Ratio = proportions(n))
Gender_report
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\gender distribution.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.

About the figures, there are gender distribution from original data and own survey data. What we’ve gleaned is that gender is not distributed fairly, skew towards Male customers. 


### Income distribution (Feamle ana Male)

```{r, echo = F}
# Income distribution
p1a <- ggplot(starbucks_revise, aes(x = Income_Bracket))

p1b <- p1a + geom_bar(aes(fill=Income_Bracket))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

p1b
```
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='70%', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\p1.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


We can see that incomes of many participants are less than 25,000PLN. High-income participants make up a small percentage.

### Gender and income

Then we combine gender and income to get a broader view.
```{r, echo = F}
# combine gender and income to get a broader view.
p2a <- ggplot(starbucks_revise, aes(x = Gender))

p2b <- p2a + geom_bar(aes(fill=Income_Bracket))

p2b
```
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='70%', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\p2.png")
```


Source: Original data analysis figure.


So while customers that identify as ‘female’ outnumber ‘male’-identifying customers, they also appear to fall into lower income brackets more frequently.

We want to do some more quantitative measurements of the data. So we will create male and female income dataframes.

#### Females' income

```{r, echo = F}
# Creat Male and Female Income DFs
Gender_Income <- as.data.frame(starbucks_revise %>% count(Gender, Income_Bracket))

Female_Income <- data.frame(subset(Gender_Income, Gender == 'Female'))
Male_Income   <- data.frame(subset(Gender_Income, Gender == 'Male'))

rownames(Male_Income) <- seq(1:nrow(Male_Income))
# Summarize each income bracket by gender
sumFemale_Income <- sum(Female_Income$n)
```


```{r, echo = F}
# Here we create a dataframe for each gender that contains the average count for each income bracket.
Female_Income_Prct <- data.frame(Income_Bracket = character(), Percentage_F = numeric())

for (i in 1:nrow(Female_Income)){
  avg <- as.double(Female_Income[i,'n'] / sumFemale_Income)
  avg_brkt <- c(as.character(Female_Income[i,'Income_Bracket']), as.numeric(round(avg, 3)))
  Female_Income_Prct[i,] <- avg_brkt
}

Female_Income_Prct$Percentage <- as.numeric(as.character(Female_Income_Prct$Percentage))

Female_Income_Prct$Percentage_F = NULL
# Result
Female_Income_Prct
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\Female Income Prct.png")
```


Source: Original data analysis figure.


#### Males' income

```{r, echo = F}
# Do the same to "Male"
# Same process here as the female.
sumMale_Income <- sum(Male_Income$n)

Male_Income_Prct <- data.frame(Income_Bracket = character(), Percentage_M = numeric())

for (i in 1:nrow(Male_Income)){
  avg <- as.double(Male_Income[i,'n'] / sumMale_Income)
  avg_brkt <- c(as.character(Male_Income[i,'Income_Bracket']), as.numeric(round(avg, 3)))
  Male_Income_Prct[i,] <- avg_brkt
}

Male_Income_Prct$Percentage <- as.numeric(as.character(Male_Income_Prct$Percentage))

Male_Income_Prct$Percentage_M = NULL
## Result
Male_Income_Prct
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\Male Income Prct.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


Then we combine income and gender.
```{r, echo = F}
# And now join them together.
Income_Prct <- merge(Male_Income_Prct, Female_Income_Prct, by = 'Income_Bracket', all.x = TRUE)

colnames(Income_Prct) <- c('IncomeBracket', 'Percent_M', 'Percent_F')

Income_Prct[is.na(Income_Prct)] <- 0

Income_Prct <- gather(Income_Prct, key = 'Gender', value = 'Percent', 2:3)

Income_Prct$Percent <- Income_Prct$Percent * 100
# result
Income_Prct
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='120%', out.width='120%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\Income Prct.png")
```


Source: Original data analysis figure.


We can show them in a barplot.

```{r, echo = F}
# plot Income Bracket
p3a <- ggplot(Income_Prct, aes(x = factor(IncomeBracket, level = order_income), y = Percent, fill = Gender))

p3b <- p3a + geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') +
  coord_flip()+
  xlab('Income Bracket') +
  geom_text(aes(label = Percent), position = position_dodge2(width = 0.9), vjust = 0.5)

p3b
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='70%', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\p3.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


We can see from this barplot, over 40%  males occupy the higher income brackets (any more that 50,000PLN), most of females occupy the lower income brackets.

So we can assume that when the gender distribution is fairly even female-identifying customers lean more towards the lower income brackets,  while more males occupy the higher income brackets.

### 7 rated questions and Gender

Here are 7 more survey questions to score, and we'll analyze them next with gender.
```{r, echo = F}
# Here are 7 more survey questions to score, and we'll analyze them next with gender.
surveyAnswers <- starbucks_revise %>% select(c('Gender', 'Quality_Rating', 'Price_Rating', 'Sales_Promo_Rating', 
                                               'Ambience_Rating', 'WiFi_Rating', 'Service_Rating', 'Meetup_Rating'))

surveyAnswers_2 <- gather(surveyAnswers, key = 'Metric', value = "Rating", 2:8)

survey_by_Gender <- tapply(surveyAnswers_2$Rating, surveyAnswers_2$Gender, mean)
# result
survey_by_Gender
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\survey by gender.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


Males are slightly more favorable overall towards the brand (3.55), but not much more than women (3.49). In general, the feelings are leaning on the ‘satisfied’ side of ‘neutral’.

We can create a collated dataframe of all the surveyed, ranked variables by gender.
```{r, echo = F}
# Creating a collated dataframe of all the surveyed, ranked variables by gender.
metricsList <- c('Ambience_Rating', 'Sales_Promo_Rating', 'Quality_Rating', 'Price_Rating', 'WiFi_Rating','Service_Rating', 'Meetup_Rating')

# We made a function to act over the different metrics.
metric_mean <- function(metric){
  metric_subset <- subset(surveyAnswers_2, Metric == metric)
  return <- c(tapply(metric_subset$Rating, metric_subset$Gender, mean))
}


for (i in metricsList){
  metricmean <- metric_mean(i)
  if (i == 'Ambience_Rating'){
    surveyMeansDF = data.frame('AmbRat' = metricmean)
  }
  else{
    surveyMeansDF[[i]] <- metricmean
  }
}

surveyMeansDF <- rownames_to_column(surveyMeansDF)

colnames(surveyMeansDF)[which(names(surveyMeansDF) == 'rowname')] <- 'Gender'
# result
surveyMeansDF

survey_means_plot <- gather(surveyMeansDF, key = 'Metric', value = 'Rating', 2:8)
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\suveryMeansDF.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


```{r, echo = F}
# plot
p4a <- ggplot(survey_means_plot, aes(x = Metric, y = Rating))

p4b <- p4a + geom_bar(aes(fill = Gender), position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + theme(axis.text = element_text(size =8)) + coord_flip()
# result
p4b
```
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='70%', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\p4.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


The results are not very different by gender. Men and women are fairly similar in their ratings, but there are some difference in a few areas:
Women are more satisfied with *Sales/Promotions*, while men are more satisfied with *the use of Starbucks for meetings/get-togethers* and  *quality of coffee*.

### Spending and Gender

Check which gender spends more per trip: “Spending”.
```{r, echo = F}
# Check which gender spends more per trip: “Spending”.
spendingDF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Gender, Spending, Membership)

spendingDF <- spendingDF %>% count(Gender, Spending, Membership)

spending_byGenDF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Gender, Spending)

spending_byGenDF  <- spending_byGenDF  %>% count(Gender, Spending)
# result
spending_byGenDF
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\spendingGender.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


```{r, echo = F}
# use ordered spending data
order_spending <- c('0 PLN', 'Less than 20 PLN', '20 PLN - 40 PLN', 'More than 40 PLN')
# plot 
pl_spending <- ggplot(spending_byGenDF, aes(x = factor(Spending, levels = order_spending), y = n), levels)

p5b <- pl_spending + geom_bar(aes(fill = Gender), position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + xlab('Spending/Visit')
# result
p5b
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='70%', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\p5.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


We can see that most of the cost are in the range greater than 0 PLN but not more than 40 PLN. The top overall spends 20 PLN - 40 PLN. While more men spend between 20 PLN and 40 PLN, and only men spend more than 40 PLN at a time in this survey.

So we can conclude that *men are more willing than women to pay for a visit, regardless of the amount*.

### Membership and Gender

Next, we analyze whether membership is related to Gender.
```{r, echo = F}
# Let’s see if there’s a gender disparity with members:
memberDF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Gender, Membership)

memberDF <- memberDF %>% count(Gender, Membership)
# result
memberDF
```
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\MemeberDF.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.


Men are more likely to have a membership than women.

### Willingness to continue buying and Gender

Now that we know that men and women rate Starbucks similarly but not identically, we will analyze whether there is a significant difference in the willingness to continue to buy between different genders.
```{r, echo = F}
# For now, we are going to do a couple more comparisons.
continuebuyingDF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Gender, Cont_Buying)

continuebuyingDF <- continuebuyingDF %>% count(Gender, Cont_Buying)
# result
continuebuyingDF
```
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\gendercout_buying.png")
```
Source: Original data analysis figure.


About 87% participants say they’ll keep going to Starbucks. So most of men and women are willing to continue to buy Starbucks, regardless of variable gender. 

###  Membership and Spending

The difference in spending between members and non-members
```{r, echo = F}
# Spending and Membership:
buying_member_DF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Membership, Spending)

buying_member_DF <- buying_member_DF %>% count(Membership, Spending)
# result
buying_member_DF
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\buyingmember_DF.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.

Members and non-Members are spending about the same.


### Willing to continue buying and Membership

We know that members' willingness to continue to buy is unquestionable, but we don't know the willingness of non-members to continue to buy, so we analyze the willingness of members and non-members to continue to buy.
```{r, echo = F}
## Membership and Willingness to continue buying
cont_member_DF <- starbucks_revise %>% select(Membership, Cont_Buying)

cont_member_DF <- cont_member_DF %>% count(Membership, Cont_Buying)
# result
cont_member_DF
```

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, out.height='150%', out.width='150%'}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/1. 学习\\3. Data Science专业课程\\第四学期\\Reproducible Research\\讲义\\RR_project_new\\RR_Starbucks-main\\fig\\membercout_buying.png")
```

Source: Original data analysis figure.

In our survey, members and non-Members are spending about the same. However, members are generally the only group that will spend more than 40 PLN (that group is entirely men). 

Also, men are more likely to spend 20PLN - 40PLN, where as women are less likely to spend in the upper half of the spending brackets.

Among non-members, the gap between who will continue to buy and who will not continue to buy is not large.

## Summary

* Women are more satisfied with *Sales/Promotions*, while men are more satisfied with *the use of Starbucks for meetings/get-togethers* and  *quality of coffee*.

* Men and women are in consensus that the factor from the survey in most need of improvement is pricing.

* Women are generally more satisfied about Starbucks across all measured metrics, except pricing.

* Males are more likely to have a membership than women.

## Consideration

* Survey members to understand the factors that contributed to their decisions to become members, Survey non-members, what caused them not to become members. Because we found that there are many participants (15/39) who are non-members but they are still willing to continue to buy.

* Gain and target more male visitors, since their spending per visit is generally higher; this can be done through targeting them via their memberships since men are more likely to be members than women. Men are also most satisfied about using Starbucks as a meet-up/gathering spot. 

* The female consumer group cannot be ignored, but also are less likely to spend as much as men per visit. Considering this, as well as their slightly higher satisfaction with sales and promotions, target sales and promotions towards women. Since it will take more women visiting to spend as much as men, Therefore, Starbucks needs more female consumers to participate in promotional activities.
